# Introduction 

#### This is a Power Bi project on global terrorism, the reason for this project is to track the event of terrorism across the globle,to view the impact on human, properties, looking at the types of weapon been used, where attackers target more, period of the year where attacks are most likely to be high, the region of the world mostly affected by these attacks,the terrorist organisation involved, the casuality figures.
#### The goal is to get insightful knowledge on the trend and activites of terrorist organisations accross the globe.

# Skills demonstrated for this project:

#### * Data cleaning
#### * Filter/tooltips
#### * Critical analysis
#### * Data visualition
#### * Problem solving

# Problem statement

#### - To know the effect of global terror on human lives
#### - To study the kind of weapon used over time
#### - To check the trend of the facilities that gets attack most
#### - To view the part of the world that is most affected by this terror

# Data Sourcing 

##### After critically defining the problem with global terror and what we seek to achive with this analysis,I obtained a xlsx file from kaggle.com and imported it into my Power Bi. I cleaned the data, and then performed my analysis and created visualizations to help answer my questions.

# Data transformation/cleaning

#### The xlxs file was downloaded from kaggle.com imported into Power Bi,the data was dirty so I proceeded to use Power Query in Power Bi Bi to visualize,analyze the data theregy perfoming some critical cleaning using the filter/tooltips.

This column contains null values that will greatly affect the outcome of the data set,so I had to convert it to 0 since it is not blank,so if the data is available for it later it can be inputed.
